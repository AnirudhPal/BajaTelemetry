I am putting together a user-guide to make sure you guys can set this up yourself whenever necessary.

## Setup

This step assumes that something is broken and you want to setup from scratch. You will need the following hardware:

* Android/iOS Phone (Android is Better)
* Raspberry Pi
* SD Card
* Laptop with SD Card Reader
* Keyboard
* Mouse
* Monitor with HDMI

### Download OS and Flash

Follow the instructions in the installation guide and install the Raspbian Lite OS on the SD card.
