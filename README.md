I am putting together a user-guide to make sure you guys can set this up yourself whenever necessary.

## Setup

This step assumes that something is broken and you want to setup from scratch. You will need the following hardware:

* Android/iOS Phone (Android is Better)
* Raspberry Pi
* SD Card
* Laptop with SD Card Reader
* Keyboard
* Monitor with HDMI

### Download OS and Flash

Follow the instructions in the installation guide and install the Raspbian Lite OS on the SD card. The OS image can be found in the link below.

### Setup Raspberry Pi, Laptop and Phone

* Set phone to enable hotpsot. 
* Have a fixed password. 
* Connect the laptop to that hotspot. **Minimize Data Usage**. 
* Connect the Pi to that hotpsot. The Pi should auto connect after boot once this is done.
   * Put SD Card into the Pi.
   * Connect monitor & keyboard to the Pi.
   * Connect power.
   * Wait for OS to boot.
   * Login using user id & password. 
   * Use terminal to connect to hotspot using instructions [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/wireless-cli.md).
